<h2>Melting Ice Sheets:</h2>
<h3>What is melting ice sheets?</h3>

<p>Melting ice sheets refer to the loss of ice mass from the polar ice caps (Greenland and Antarctica) and other glaciers.</p>

<h3>Causes of melting ice sheets</h3>

<br>1. Rising global temperatures
<br>2. Changes in ocean currents and temperature
<br>3. Increased greenhouse gas emissions

<h3>Effects of melting ice sheets</h3>

<br>1. Sea-level rise
<br>2. Changes in ocean circulation and salinity
<br>3. Loss of habitat for polar ecosystems
<br>4. Increased risk of glacier calving

<h3>Consequences of melting ice sheets</h3>

<br>1. Coastal flooding and erosion
<br>2. Disruption of global weather patterns
<br>3. Loss of freshwater resources
<br>4. Impacts on marine ecosystems and biodiversity

<h3>Visual Illustration of melting ice sheets</h3>

<p>Imagine the Arctic ice cap shrinking:</p>

<br>1980: 7.5 million km²
<br>2020: 4.5 million km²
<br>2050: 2.5 million km² (projected)

<h3>Regional Examples of melting ice sheets
</h3>

<br>1. Greenland Ice Sheet (losing 200-300 billion tons of ice/year)
<br>2. Antarctic Ice Sheet (losing 150 billion tons of ice/year)
<br>3. Glacier National Park, Montana (lost 75% of glaciers since 1966)

<h3>What Can We Do for it?</h3>

<br>1. Reduce greenhouse gas emissions
<br>2. Protect and preserve natural ice sheets
<br>3. Support climate-resilient infrastructure
<br>4. Promote sustainable water management

<br>- Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)

<h3>Key statistics and projections:</h3>

<br>- Ice sheet melting: 500 billion tons/year (2013-2018)
<br>- Projected sea-level rise by 2100: 26 cm to 82 cm
<br>- Glacier loss: 75% by 2050 (Glacier National Park)
