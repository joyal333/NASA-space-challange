<h2>Increasingly Heavy Rainfall:</h2>

<h3>What is it?</h3>

<p>Heavy rainfall events are intense precipitation periods that exceed historical averages.</p>
<br><img src="/photo/image11.jpg">
<h3>Causes:</h3>

<br>1. Rising global temperatures
<br>2. Increased atmospheric moisture (4% increase per degree Celsius)
<br>3. Changes in atmospheric circulation patterns

<h3>Effects:</h3>

<br>1. Flash flooding
<br>2. Landslides and mudslides
<br>3. Agricultural damage
<br>4. Urban flooding and infrastructure overload


<h3>Consequences:</h3>

<br>1. Loss of life and property
<br>2. Displacement of communities
<br>3. Economic disruption
<br>4. Environmental degradation

<h3>Visual Illustration:</h3>

<h3>Imagine a rainfall intensity increase:</h3>

<br>1980s: 10 mm/hour
<br>2020s: 15 mm/hour
<br>2050s: 20 mm/hour (projected)

<h3>Regional Examples:</h3>

<br>1. Hurricane Harvey (2017): 60 inches of rainfall in Houston
<br>2. Kerala Floods (2018): 40% of India's annual rainfall in 2 weeks
<br>3. Midwestern US Floods (2019): $3 billion in damages

<h3>What Can We Do?</h3>

<br>1. Reduce greenhouse gas emissions
<br>2. Improve flood forecasting and warning systems
<br>3. Enhance infrastructure resilience
<br>4. Support climate change adaptation and resilience efforts


<h3>Some reliable sources for further information:</h3>

<br>- National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
<br>- National Weather Service (NWS)
<br>- Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
<br>- Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)

<h3>Key statistics and projections:</h3>

<br>- Increase in heavy rainfall events: 20% since 1990
<br>- Projected increase in extreme rainfall: 30% by 2050
<br>- Estimated annual damages from flooding: $100 billion
