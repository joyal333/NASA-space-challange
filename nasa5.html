<h2>Increasingly Fossil Fuels:</h2>


<h3>What is it?</h3>

<p>Fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas) are non-renewable energy sources releasing carbon dioxide (CO2) when burned.</p>
<br><img src="/photo/image14.jpg">
<h3>Causes:</h3>

<br>1. Energy demand growth
<br>2. Economic development
<br>3. Lack of renewable energy infrastructure

<h3>Effects:</h3>

<br>1. Greenhouse gas emissions (CO2, CH4, N2O)
<br>2. Air pollution (particulates, ozone)
<br>3. Water pollution (extraction, transportation)
<br>4. Land degradation (mining, drilling)



<br>1. Climate change acceleration
<br>2. Human health impacts (respiratory issues, cancer)
<br>3. Environmental degradation
<br>4. Resource depletion

<h3>Visual Illustration:</h3>



<br>1900: 1.5 billion barrels/year
<br>2020: 33.7 billion barrels/year
<br>2050: 50 billion barrels/year (projected)

<h3>Regional Examples:</h3>

<br>1. US: 20% of global fossil fuel consumption
<br>2. China: 25% of global fossil fuel consumption
<br>3. EU: 15% of global fossil fuel consumption

<h3>What Can We Do?</h3>

<br>1. Transition to renewable energy (solar, wind, hydro)
<br>2. Increase energy efficiency
<br>3. Electrify transportation and industry
<br>4. Carbon capture and storage
<br>5. Sustainable land-use practices





<h3>Some reliable sources for further information:</h3>

<br>- International Energy Agency (IEA)
<br>- National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
<br>- Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
<br>- Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)

<h3>Key statistics and projections:</h3>

<br>- Increase in fossil fuel emissions: 50% since 1990
<br>- Projected increase in global temperature: 2-5Â°C by 2100
<br>- Estimated annual costs of climate change: $1.7 trillion
